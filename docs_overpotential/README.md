# Welcome to the Overflower Team
This project contributes to the characterization and measurement of our Redox Flow Battery, specifically the overpotential.
The existence of overpotential means less energy is recovered than thermodynamics predicts.
Measuring the overpotential is directly related to the voltage efficiency of the battery.
Our current hardware design supports any type of battery up to about 4V.

## How do we do it?
We will initiate this project by creating program and setting up the electronic instruments to measure voltage and capacity 
of an existing rechargeable battery.
By using the measurement procedure made by V. Pop et al., we measure the overpotential of the battery.
After the program works and measurements are successful, we will apply it to our flow battery.

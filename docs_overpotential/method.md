## Measurements
For a Li-Ion battery we perform the following measurement procedures.
### EMF
Charge and discharge the battery at a constant current.
Perform Coulomb counting to keep track of SoC.
Measure the voltage and average the charge and discharge voltage at equal SoC.

#### Charging
Charge at 0.05 C to 4.2 V, measure voltage while charging.

#### Discharging
Discharge at 0.05 C to 3 V, measure voltage while discharging.

#### Notes
This measurement takes a long time. It may be beneficial to trade off accuracy for experiment time by increasing the current and reducing rest time.

### Overpotential
Charge and discharge the battery at a constant current of 0.5 C while measuring the voltage and Coulomb counting.
The difference between this voltage and the EMF at the same SoC is the overpotential.
